# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Contents so far:

- milestone_2.py, which prompts the 
user for a single letter to guess to a randomly selected fruit, and checks 
the input.
- milestone_3.py, contains two functions that 1) takes in an input 
guess and checks it against requirements 2) checks whether the letter is 
in the word (not in this file but presumably the 'word' defined in 
milestone_2.py).
- milestone_4 contains a class of hangman objects with methods similar to 
the functions in the above files built into it.
